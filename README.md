Virtual Art Showcase - Project Plan
Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a simple, user-friendly platform where team members can showcase their artwork. The platform will allow friends, family, and visitors to easily navigate and view the artwork in an organized virtual space. Each artist will have a dedicated section for their work, biography, and descriptions of their creative process.

Project Objectives
Create a simple website or presentation platform to showcase the artwork of all team members.
Provide individual sections for each artist, including an art description and biography.
Ensure the platform is accessible and user-friendly for both artists and visitors, making it easy to navigate.

Project Scope
The website will serve as an online gallery where users can browse the artwork, read about each artist, and learn about their creative process.

Technology Stack Options:

More Advanced Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a framework like Bootstrap for responsive design.
Hosting: Static website hosting services like GitHub Pages or Netlify.
Version Control: GitHub for managing project code and collaboration.
Simple Tech Stack (Less Advanced)

Website Builder: Wix or WordPress, providing a drag-and-drop interface for easy website creation.
Image Hosting: Direct uploads to the website builder or Google Drive for larger file management.
Feedback System: Use of Google Forms or built-in comment features on Wix/WordPress.

Methodology: Scrum

We will use the Scrum methodology to organize our project. This will allow us to work iteratively, delivering incremental progress through short, focused work periods called sprints. Each sprint will last two weeks and will culminate in a review and planning session to prepare for the next sprint.

Scrum Roles
Product Owner: Responsible for defining the project vision, goals, and requirements. Also prioritizes tasks.
Scrum Master: Ensures the team follows Scrum practices, facilitates meetings, and removes obstacles.
Development Team: Responsible for executing tasks and delivering project increments.

Product Backlog
The product backlog includes all the tasks needed to complete the project. The team will prioritize these tasks and select a manageable set for each sprint. Example tasks include:

Setting up the GitHub repository
Designing the homepage layout
Uploading artwork and biographies
Implementing responsive design features
Testing and debugging the website
Preparing the final presentation
Sprints & Timeline
Sprint	Timeline	Objectives
Sprint 1	Weeks 1-2	Project setup: Create GitHub repository, assign roles, define project structure
Sprint 2	Weeks 2-3	Design homepage layout using HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
Sprint 3	Weeks 3-4	Develop artist pages and implement navigation
Sprint 4	Weeks 4-5	Upload content: artwork, biographies, and adjust page layouts for consistency
Sprint 5	Weeks 5-7	Implement interactivity, ensure responsiveness, and conduct user experience testing
Sprint 6	Weeks 7-8	Finalize design, deploy the website, write documentation, and prepare the final presentation

Daily Stand-ups
Each day, the team will conduct a short, 15-minute meeting (stand-up) where each member shares:

What they did yesterday
What they plan to do today
Any blockers or issues they are facing
Sprint Review & Retrospective
At the end of each sprint, we will hold two meetings:

Sprint Review: Demonstrate the completed work to the team and any stakeholders. Gather feedback to incorporate into the next sprint.
Sprint Retrospective: Reflect on the team's performance, discuss what went well, what can be improved, and any changes for the next sprint.
Technology Stack Decision
We are considering two approaches based on the team's skill level and project requirements:

Advanced Approach: Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with Bootstrap for a custom-built, responsive website.
Simple Approach: Use a drag-and-drop website builder (Wix or WordPress) for quicker deployment with less coding effort.
The final decision will be based on the team's comfort level with coding and the desired level of customization.

Conclusion
By following the Scrum methodology, we aim to ensure a structured yet flexible approach to building our Virtual Art Showcase. Through regular iterations and feedback, we will deliver a polished, user-friendly platform where our artwork can be appreciated by a wide audience.
