Project Plan: Virtual Art Showcase
1. Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a simple, user-friendly platform where team members can showcase their artwork. The platform will allow friends, family, and visitors to easily navigate and view the artwork in an organized virtual space. Each artist will have a dedicated section for their work, biography, and descriptions of their creative process.

2. Project Objectives

    Create a simple website or presentation platform to showcase the artwork of all team members.
    Provide individual sections for each artist, including an art description and biography.
    Keep the platform easily accessible and user-friendly for both artists and visitors, ensuring it is easy to navigate.

3. Project Scope

The website will serve as an online gallery where users can browse the artwork, read about each artist, and learn about their creative process.

The scope of the project will depend on the tools and technology chosen. We are considering two possible approaches:

  Simple Tech Stack: Using drag-and-drop website builders (e.g., Wix or WordPress), which will allow for quicker deployment and simpler management.

  More Advanced Tech Stack: If we choose to use custom code, we may explore building a static site using tools like HTML/CSS/JavaScript or a simple web framework like Bootstrap for easier design and layout customization. 
  This approach will require a bit more development work but will offer more flexibility in terms of design and functionality.

4. Technology Stack

Given the team's skill level, we are still deciding between two approaches, each with its own advantages:

Option 1: More Advanced Tech Stack

  Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a framework like Bootstrap to ensure responsive design.
  Hosting: Static website hosting services like GitHub Pages or Netlify.
  Version Control: GitHub for managing project code and collaboration.

Option 2: Simple Tech Stack (Less Advanced)

   Website Builder: Wix or WordPress. These platforms offer drag-and-drop interfaces that allow for easy website creation without the need for coding.
   Image Hosting: Direct uploads to the website builder or Google Drive for larger file management.
   Feedback System: Use of Google Forms or the built-in comment feature provided by Wix/WordPress.

5. Milestones & Timeline

The project will be broken into key phases to ensure a smooth development process using the more advanced tech stack. Here's the timeline with estimated completion dates for each phase:
Week 1: Project Setup

Milestone 1: Initial Setup
    Create GitHub Repository: Set up a GitHub repository for version control and collaboration.
    Define Project Structure: Create the initial folder structure for the website (e.g., HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files).
    Assign Roles & Responsibilities: Each team member will be assigned a specific role (e.g., frontend design, content writing, etc.).


Week 2-3: Frontend Design

Milestone 2: Design the Website Layout Using HTML/CSS/Bootstrap

  Set Up the Basic Layout: Create a responsive homepage and internal pages using HTML and Bootstrap.
   Design Artist Pages: Each artist will have a dedicated page with sections for artwork, biography, and creative process description.

    Test User Experience: Test the website for user experience (UX), making sure it’s easy to navigate and content loads properly.
    Debugging: Fix any issues that arise during testing (e.g., broken links, layout issues).


Week 8: Final Touches & Hosting

Milestone 5: Finalize and Deploy the Website

   Finalize Design: Apply any final adjustments to design, layout, or content based on test feedback.
    Deploy Website: Deploy the website using GitHub Pages or Netlify for hosting.
    Documentation: Write and upload technical documentation on GitHub, explaining the website's structure, technologies used, and how to maintain/update it.


Week 8: Presentation Preparation

Milestone 6: Prepare Final Presentation

  Create a Slide Deck: Prepare a presentation that includes an overview of the project, the process, key features of the website, and a live demo.
