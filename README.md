Virtual Art Showcase - Project Plan
Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a simple, user-friendly platform where team members can showcase their artwork.

Provide individual sections for each artist, including an art description and biography.
Ensure the platform is accessible and user-friendly for both artists and visitors, making it easy to navigate.
